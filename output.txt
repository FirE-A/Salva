What's the best thing you've got going on in your life at the moment?
In the seconds before you die, you are allowed to know everyone who was secretly in love with you at some point. Do you want to know?
In  years' time, will you be proud of what you are doing now?
What does your inner voice tell you?
What do you need to stop doing to make space for bigger changes?
What have you done recently to overcome one of your fears?
What do you fear?
What's the most courageous thing you have ever done?
What are your strongest beliefs?
What's the dialogue you really need to have but haven't had so far?
